# postgresql-py
Postgresql-py is a program that just connects to a SQL server in pure python -no framewok-

## Description 
I was trying to connect to SQL servers without frameworks in order to make a terminal application. This is just a backup for the code that worked for me 

## Future plans
Incoporate oop for a better exporting of the whole program

## usage so far
- create a .ini file _db.ini_ in this case. Inside it add:
> [ SQL version ] _can be mysql postgres or any of your chosing_

> hostname= _the IP address for your server/ localhost_

> db_name= _the name of the database to connect to_

> db_user= _the nam of the user who is connecting to the db_

> Password= _the password to connect to the database if any is required_

 - in the dbfunc.py edit the query apropriately  
> Add Delete Create Update
